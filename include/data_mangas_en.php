The reality is however very different, because Denji is constrained by the Yakuzas to kill demons in order to reimburse his overwhelming debts. Using his demon Pochita as a weapon, he is ready for anything for a little money. 
        Alas, he no longer does the trick and is assassinated by a devil on contract with the Yakuzas. Nevertheless, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with the dead body of Denji and gives it the powers of a screw -up demon. Capable of transforming parts of his body into a chainsaw, Denji, once resurrected, uses his new capacities to quickly and brutally eliminate his enemies. 
        The official demons who arrive at the scene admire him and offer him to work at the Office of Public Security. Now having ways to face the toughest enemies, Denji will not go back to nothing to realize his teenage dreams. ',
